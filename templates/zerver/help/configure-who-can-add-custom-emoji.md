# Change who can add custom emoji

By default, anyone other than guests can [add custom emoji](/help/add-custom-emoji) to the
organization. However, you can restrict the permission to add custom emoji to other sets of
roles:

* Organization administrators
* Organization administrators and moderators
* Organization administrators and all members
* Organization administrators and [full members](/help/restrict-permissions-of-new-members)
